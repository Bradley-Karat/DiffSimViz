### About

DiffSimViz (Diffusion Simulator Visualizer) is a python toolbox CLI with the aim of providing intuitive visualizations of particle diffusion in different media/microstructure.

### Inspiration

The brain is made up of water molecules and brain cells (axons, dendrites, and cell bodies) which are on a micron scale. The movement of these water molecules gives us some anatomical information about brain cells. Important for understanding diseased states and for improving our knowledge about human cognition. Diffusion MRI leverages the movement of these water molecules and thus, it can be difficult to understand for newcomers to the field, and they would benefit from simplified visuals which depict the diffusion process.

The use of such a visualizer will be didactic or for researchers to better understand what their diffusion MRI signal might look like in particular microstructural environments.
